Given a subject's data, inference can\\nbe made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the\\nsubject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual\\nmeasurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely\\nused, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,\\nis rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of\\ndispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction\\nmethod, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive\\nmodeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically\\naims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite\\nsample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type\\nalgorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic\\nmanner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed\\nas a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are\\nestimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental\\nevaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the\\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on\\nsynthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy\\ncompared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the\\nADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between\\nsubject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers\\nof Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score\\nand Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\\beta$ levels. Further reliability studies on\\nthe longitudinal ADNI dataset show improvement on detection reliability when\\nRSM is used.\\n  1                 0        0            0           0                     0                       1\n",

As people rely on social media as their primary sources of news, the spread\\nof misinformation has become a significant concern. In this large-scale study\\nof news in social media we analyze eleven million posts and investigate\\npropagation behavior of users that directly interact with news accounts\\nidentified as spreading trusted versus malicious content. Unlike previous work,\\nwhich looks at specific rumors, topics, or events, we consider all content\\npropagated by various news sources. Moreover, we analyze and contrast\\npopulation versus sub-population behaviour (by demographics) when spreading\\nmisinformation, and distinguish between two types of propagation, i.e., direct\\nretweets and mentions. Our evaluation examines how evenly, how many, how\\nquickly, and which users propagate content from various types of news sources\\non Twitter.\\nOur analysis has identified several key differences in propagation behavior\\nfrom trusted versus suspicious news sources. These include high inequity in the\\ndiffusion rate based on the source of disinformation, with a small group of\\nhighly active users responsible for the majority of disinformation spread\\noverall and within each demographic. Analysis by demographics showed that users\\nwith lower annual income and education share more from disinformation sources\\ncompared to their counterparts. News content is shared significantly more\\nquickly from trusted, conspiracy, and disinformation sources compared to\\nclickbait and propaganda. Older users propagate news from trusted sources more\\nquickly than younger users, but they share from suspicious sources after longer\\ndelays. Finally, users who interact with clickbait and conspiracy sources are\\nlikely to share from propaganda accounts, but not the other way around.\\n                                                                                                                                                         1                 0        0            0           0                     0                       1\n",
